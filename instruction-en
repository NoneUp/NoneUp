🌟 How to Play 2048 – The Ultimate Guide 🌟
2048 is a captivating puzzle game where you merge tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile—or go even further! Here’s everything you need to know to master the game.

🎮 Game Basics
Board: 4×4 grid with numbered tiles.

Goal: Combine tiles to create 2048 (or aim higher!).

Controls: Swipe (↑ ↓ ← →) to move all tiles at once.

🔄 How It Works
Start: Two tiles (2 or 4) appear randomly.

Move: Swipe in any direction—tiles slide until they hit the edge or another tile.

Merge: When two identical tiles collide, they fuse into one (2+2=4, 4+4=8, etc.).

New Tile: After every move, a new 2 or 4 spawns in an empty spot.

Game Over: When the grid is full and no moves remain, it’s game over.

🏆 Pro Tips to Dominate 2048
✅ Corner Strategy: Lock your highest tile in a corner (e.g., bottom-right) and build around it.
✅ Stack Smartly: Keep tiles in descending order (e.g., 16, 8, 4, 2) along one edge.
✅ Plan Ahead: Avoid random swipes—think 2-3 moves ahead to prevent gridlock.
✅ Stay Flexible: If stuck, shift focus to another corner to free up space.

🚀 Challenge Yourself! Can you reach 4096 or even 8192? Every merge brings you closer to victory!
